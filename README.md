# Implementation-of-Differential-Revolution-for-QWOP

QWOP refers to a game where a player uses Q, W, O and P to adjust the thighs and calves of a runner on the screen so that it can run as far as possible.

The physical engine of QWOP, a function, is defined and we try to find the solution that maximize the function.

Since the function is complex and most likely to be indifferentiable, traditional optimization methods like gradient descent won't be efficient. Hence, I implemented differential revolution algorithm that does not require differentiability to attempt to solve this problem.
